    <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p> RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol. It forwards packets through UDP and uses timers to control the advertisement, update, and aging of routing information. <br> However, design defects in RIP may cause routing loops. Therefore, split horizon, poison reverse, and triggered update were introduced into RIP to avoid routing loops.

            <br>In addition, RIP periodically advertises its routing table to neighbors, and route summarization was introduced to reduce the size of the routing table.
