    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>IS-IS is a dynamic routing protocol initially designed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).<br> To support IP routing, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) extends and modifies IS-IS in relevant standards, which enables IS-IS to be applied to both TCP/IP and Open System Interconnection (OSI) environments. <br>The new type of IS-IS is called Integrated IS-IS or Dual IS-IS.IS-IS uses the SPF algorithm to calculate routes. It is characterized by fast convergence and high scalability. <br> Running at the data link layer, IS-IS has strong anti-attack capabilities and can implement interworking on large-scale networks.
